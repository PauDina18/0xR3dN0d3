# Level 1: Cynthia Cabrera – OSINT Report

## 1. Alias and Identification

Through username enumeration using tools such as **Namecheckr**, **PimEyes**, and **WhatsMyName**, we identified multiple online aliases linked to the subject, including the handle **cyntax_cyber**.

Subsequent manual investigation on Instagram confirmed that **@cyntax_cyber** is an active profile associated with the subject. The account features digital artwork and uses the initials “C.C.,” which correspond with the subject’s known name, **Cynthia Cabrera**.

The presence of stylized, minimalistic line art further supports the notion that the subject uses this account for artistic expression, potentially as a form of identity obfuscation or as part of her legitimate interests. The language used (“just a part-time artist”) suggests the account is not her main persona, which could imply compartmentalization of identities for operational security (OPSEC).
