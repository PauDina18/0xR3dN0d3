# MISSION BRIEFING

Intelligence indicates that Cynthia Cabrera has left her base of operations in Medellín, Colombia and is currently en route to Mexico. Our sources confirm she is traveling to meet a friend she trusts from the DarkNet and has known for years.

The purpose of this meeting is currently unknown, but given Cabrera's technical expertise, we suspect a potential collaboration on a new cybercrime operation. It is critical that we pinpoint her exact movements and final destination to deploy field agents for surveillance.

Cabrera is moving fast and trying to maintain OPSEC as best as possible, but our intelligence suggests she has left digital breadcrumbs that can be used to track her journey from Colombia to Mexico.
